Scenario: Employee Management System (Console-Based)
-----------------------------------------------------
You are tasked with developing a simple console-based Employee Management System using C# that allows users to manage a list of employees. Use a menu-driven approach to perform CRUD operations on a List<Employee>.

Each Employee has the following properties:

int Id

string Name

string Department

double Salary
 Functional Requirements
Design a menu that repeatedly prompts the user to choose one of the following actions:


===== Employee Management Menu =====
1. Add New Employee
2. View All Employees
3. Search Employee by ID
4. Update Employee Details
5. Delete Employee
6. Exit
====================================
Enter your choice:

 Task:
Write a C# program using:

A class Employee with the above properties.

A List<Employee> to hold all employee records.

A menu-based loop to allow the user to perform the following:

✅ Expected Functionalities (CRUD)

1.Prompt the user to enter details for a new employee and add it to the list.


2.Display all employees 

3.Allow searching an employee by Id and display their details.

4.Search for an employee by Id, and if found, allow the user to update name, department, or salary.

5.Search for an employee by Id and remove the employee from the list.

6.Cleanly exit the program.

Use Exception handling Mechanism

Events and Delegates


Scenario: Mobile Phone – Ring Notification System
You are simulating a mobile phone that can ring when someone calls. Different parts of the phone (like ringtone player, screen display, and vibration motor) need to react to the ring event.

To model this, use delegates and events.

🎯 Task:
Implement the following in C#:

1. MobilePhone class
Has a delegate RingEventHandler and an event OnRing.

Has a method ReceiveCall() which triggers the OnRing event.

2. Subscriber classes (handlers):
RingtonePlayer – prints: "Playing ringtone..."

ScreenDisplay – prints: "Displaying caller information..."

VibrationMotor – prints: "Phone is vibrating..."

3. In the Main() method:
Create an instance of MobilePhone.

Subscribe all three components to the OnRing event.

Call ReceiveCall() to simulate an incoming call.
